# Book Review API :open_book::feather:
<h2>Introduction:books:</h2>
<p>Are you ready to embark on a journey to learn about the powerful world of APIs? An API, or Application 
Programming Interface, is a collection of protocols, routines, and tools that enable software applications 
to communicate and exchange information with one another. The goal of this mini project is to build a 
robust backend using Spring Boot and its various modules to create a Book Review API. The building approach
for this project is monolithic, utilizing PostgreSQL as the database and deploying the app on the Tomcat server.</p>
